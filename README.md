# Python-Virtual-Assistant

This a fourth semester python mini project. This virtual assistant contains features likes, text to speech, jokes, downloading videos from youTube by copy pasting the link, setting reminders and giving you the first search result when you google search for anything. It uses modules- pyttsx3, pyjokes, pytube, googlesearch, win10toast and customTkinter. As a future endeavour, i plan on making the GUI more beautiful and interactive. I also plan on adding facial recognition, speech recognition, integrating weather APIs, mini-games and much more
